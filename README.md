# monsters-rolodex
A basic project I used to introduce myself to the concepts of the React Library (e.g. Component-based architecure, Unidirectional data flow, search..)

Note : The API where the monsters information is pulled from is inconsistent, so there will be moments where no content will appear on the webpage.
